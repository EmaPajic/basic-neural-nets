# basic-neural-nets
Implementation of some basic neural networks for Neural Networks course in keras. 
In this dataset, there are 2 classes. Class 0 has a lot less samples and it is more important for classification than class 1.

This way of trying multiple networks with for should normally be removed, this was just because of course assignment requirements.
